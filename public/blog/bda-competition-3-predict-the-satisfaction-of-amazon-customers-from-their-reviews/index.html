<h2>Description of project</h2>
<p>In this competition your task is to build a classifier that automatically recognize customer satisfaction from textual reviews of baby products that were sold on Amazon.com. Reviews and 5 star ratings were collected by Amazon on their site by inviting customers to enter a review of a product that had bought.</p>
<p>In stead of relying on pre-trained features (such as the NRC and Afinn word lists), you will rely on automatic methods for feature selection.</p>
</div>
<div id="my-role" class="section level2">
<h2>My role</h2>
<p><em>Note</em>:We had to predict whether a customer gave a rating of &gt;3, or not. This was therefore a classification problem. Customers with ratings of 4 and 5 were marked as ‘satisfied’, else, ‘not satisfied’.</p>
<p>In this competition we have had a large number of predictors (tokens) created with the tidytext R package. Our role was to reduce the number of predictors to the most important ones (decrease model flexibility). I used the lasso binary classification method with the function ‘cv.glmnet’ from the ‘glmnet’ R package to fint the optimal value for lambda (the ‘cost’ parameter for model complexity). This method gave us an initial accuracy of 91.3% on the train data. Our final score was 95% which we achieved with some added features such as ngrams(with n = 2,3).</p>
<div id="code-for-fitting" class="section level3">
<h3>Code for fitting</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>#Modeling using glmnet
y = used_amazon$class
fit_lasso_lm = glmnet(dtm[trainidx, ], y[trainidx], family = &#39;binomial&#39;) #Response type

#Getting optimal lambda
cv.out &lt;- cv.glmnet(dtm[trainidx,],y[trainidx], alpha=1)
bestlam &lt;- cv.out$lambda.min # the value that has the smallest cross-validation error

#Drawing up lambda chosen
abline(v=log(bestlam), lwd = 3, col = &#39;red&#39;)

#Predicted probabilities for train data
pred = predict(fit_lasso_lm, s=bestlam, newx=dtm[trainidx, ], type=&quot;response&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="old-vs.new-predictors" class="section level3">
<h3>Old vs. new predictors</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>#Getting tokens
# ngrams = 1
reviews &lt;- amazon %&gt;% 
  mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(token, review) %&gt;%
  count(id, name, rating, token) %&gt;%
  rename(unique_token_count=n)

# ngrams = 3 or we can use 2 # take a long time as n increases!
reviews_ngrams &lt;- amazon %&gt;% 
  mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(output = token, input = review, token = &quot;ngrams&quot;, n = 3, n_min = 1) %&gt;% # n-grams
  count(id, name, rating, token)</code></pre>
<p>In the end we placed 4th, but all of the predictions (except one) scored between 95% and 95.5%. We considered this to be a success, however, other teams were equally good at making these predictions.</p>
