      <description>Description of projectIn this competition your task is to build a classifier that automatically recognize customer satisfaction from textual reviews of baby products that were sold on Amazon.com. Reviews and 5 star ratings were collected by Amazon on their site by inviting customers to enter a review of a product that had bought.
In stead of relying on pre-trained features (such as the NRC and Afinn word lists), you will rely on automatic methods for feature selection.</description>
